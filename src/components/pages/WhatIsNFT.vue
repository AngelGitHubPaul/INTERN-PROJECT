        NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are distinct and cannot be replaced. They are built on blockchain technology, such as the Ethereum blockchain, and provide verifiable scarcity and provenance for various digital items like artwork, collectibles, and music. NFTs have enabled creators to directly monetize their digital creations, and NFT marketplaces have emerged as platforms for buying, selling, and trading these unique assets.
